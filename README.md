## Draw my sprites!

Due to budgetary issues, we can't afford to draw sprites for this game. (a bummer, we know).

if the player wants to play, they'll have to draw the sprites for us!

## The current state of affairs

For now, the game is incomplete. Sprites are provided for debugging purposes.

To run, open index.html. Then type `debug()` into the Javascript console.

## Roadmap

- [x] prompting the player to draw with `draw_sprite()`

- [x] allowing the player to draw

- [x] communicating with the player through `message()` and the blue box at the bottom

- [x] drawing on the screen

- [x] collision detection between the player and the walls

- [x] collision detection between the player and the coins and the goal

- [ ] intro and story?
